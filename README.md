# HomeLab Reimagined

## Codename: Compostable Infrastructure
Named *Compostable Infrastructure* as my original tweet on the topic [had a typo](https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/1413047607090352129) in it, and [Filip Verloy ran with it](https://twitter.com/filipv/status/1413048628684414978).

## Executive Summary

The purpose of this document is to describe in necessary detail the current project description to represent a suitable model generating Conceptual, Logical and Physical designs for HomeLab.

The [Conceptual Design](Conceptual.md) presents the proposed structure of the datacenter transformation project, such as the requirements, assumptions and risks involved.

The [Logical Design](Logical.md) is based on the conceptual design, and provides a more detailed view of the components and relationships.

This in turn results in a [Physical Design](Physical.md) that can be used to build the entire stack of services.

The purpose of the lab is to provide infrastructure services as well as a training ground for various technologies.

## "Business" Background

*By developing the documentation in this manner, the idea is for it to work as an exercise in writing enterprise design documents.*
